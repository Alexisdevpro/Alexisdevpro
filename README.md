 ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Alexisdevpro
I am very interested in cybersecurity.
I have a lot of knowledge from CTF and pentesting.
I share a lot of useful commands and some rootkits and RATs (Nanocore Settings, NjRat, Meterpreter,...)

My own rootkits are in private, come dm if you want. Here I share the most interesting and useful ones !

I do it all legally ðŸ˜‰ an educational purpose !
