# 👋 Hi, I'm @Alexisdevpro

I'm a student engineer in **telecommunications** at Telecom Paris, with a deep passion for **cybersecurity** and **quantum physics**. I have gained extensive knowledge through **CTF** (Capture the Flag) challenges and **pentesting**. I enjoy sharing useful commands, interesting rootkits, and educational content related to cybersecurity.

One of my key interests is **OSINT** (Open Source Intelligence), where I excel in finding hidden data and solving digital puzzles. I also have strong skills in **Forensics** and **Reversing**, driven by a passion for uncovering digital mysteries. All my activities are conducted legally and for educational purposes. 😉
